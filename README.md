# LG-V500-Kernel
kernel for LG GPad v500 (awifi) based on 5.0.2 stock source

The "StockPlus" branch is based on "rebase" and will also include patches that can be considered as bug-fixes to the original LGE stock source code. This branch is intended to represent an actively developed Stock Kernel.
