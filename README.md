# LG-V500-Kernel
kernel for LG GPad v500 (awifi) based on 5.0.2 stock source

The "rebase" branch is based on master and includes all current patches from the linux-3.4.y branch at https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/
It should be noted that some areas of the LGE stock source were not in sync with linux-3.4.0 and I have rebased those areas of code as necessary.

This branch is intended to encourage other developers to create custom kernels for the stock 5.0.2 (v30a) ROM by providing an up to date code base.
